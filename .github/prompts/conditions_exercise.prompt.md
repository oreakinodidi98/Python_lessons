## context

Prompt to generate exercise for practicing **conditions in Python**, focusing on real-world logic and flow control using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

# Core concepts to practice
- Writing clean conditional statements
- Combining logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Using `if-elif-else` blocks for branching logic
- Embedding conditions inside loops or function calls
- Ternary conditional expressions
- Handling edge cases in conditional logic

# Tasks

create `exercise{3-digit-number}.py` file inside the `/projects/workspace/` director with the following content:
- 1 exercise per file
- instructions at the top of the file and no other text (no hint or solution)
- the exercise should be self-contained, meaning it should not require any external files or libraries
- concise and clear instructions
- do not auto complete any part of the exercise
- verify the expected output is correct
- expected results should be clear and concise, focusing on the output of the comprenesion
- verify that the expected results are correct and relevant to the exercise
- Instructions must be short, specific, and clear
- Include meaningful variable names and natural use cases

## Expected results guidelines

- Expected results: [actual list or values]
- Output should reflect correct branching logic
- Edge cases should be considered where relevant
- Focus on clarity of condition evaluation and logic correctness
