## Auto-Graded Task 1

What is normalisation:

- normalisation is Normalisation is a process for evaluating and correcting table structures to minimise data redundancies and therefore reduce the likelihood of data anomalies. In other words, normalisation is a method to remove anomalies and bring the database to a consistent state.

What is 1NF

- A table is 1NF when, all of the key attributes are defined; there are no repeating groups in the table; and all attributes are dependent on the primary key

What is 2NF:

- A table is in 2NF (second Normal Format) when it is in 1NF; and it includes no partial dependencies; that is, no attribute is dependent on only a portion of the primary key.
- It is still possible for a table in 2NF to exhibit transitive dependency; that is, one or more attributes may be functionally dependent on non-key attributes (Coronel & Morris, 2014)

What is 3NF:

- When it is in 2NF; and it contains no transitive dependencies (Rob et al., 2008).

What is a Foreign key:

- A Foreign Key is which are columns that link to primary key columns in other tables, thereby creating a relationship.
