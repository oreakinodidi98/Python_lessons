# what is recursion

- breaking the problem into smaller more managable chunks
- breaking the problem into smaller pieces you already know how to solve
- when a function calls itself
- ompact and easy to understand
- fewer variables
- Iteration: use when there is limited memory and faster processing required
- recursion: ompact, understandable and inituative code -> like russian dolls
- E.G. a cake you want to share among several friends
